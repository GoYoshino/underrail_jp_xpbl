These stalactites unmistakably insinuate their arbitration over the sea and the land below them, for death from above, while pretty much omnipresent in subterranean life, has a significantly more acute, supreme and inescapably terrifying presence here than anywhere else you've ever been before. This realization pierces you mentally not unlike one of those speleothemic spears could physically.::",

And it is only being exacerbated by the many sounds violently colliding in this open space - those of air currents, restless waters and wild yet unseen life - all the while reverberating deeply and rhythmically as though all of them are combining into one singular heartbeat of the cavern itself. Somewhere out there, in the far distance, you can almost hear the faint but distinct sounds of drums and horns, the prime instruments of the underture to a mysterious play whose next act has just begun.::",
