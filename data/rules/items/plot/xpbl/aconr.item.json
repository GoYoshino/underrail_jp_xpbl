It appears to be a container of some kind, one that seems to open horizontally in the middle; you are, however, unable to find the means by which to do so - there are no handles, no locks, no buttons, touchscreens or visible sensors. Additionally, the robust casing easily discourages brute force, at least by more conventional means.<br><br>Whatever is inside, it is likely invaluable.",
