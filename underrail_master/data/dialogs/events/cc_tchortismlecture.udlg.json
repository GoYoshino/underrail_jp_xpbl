We don't worship imaginary beings, gods, devils or the like. Our robes do not exist so that we may intimidate; they have a symbolic value which will be explained... later. Everything I tell you during this lecture is based on hard evidence, on research... on scientific investigation.

Tchort is a single multicellular organism discovered by Eidein almost a century ago in Deep Caverns, and is suspected to be one of the oldest living organisms in existence - a primordial being. It is completely formless; it exists in a state of regeneration which it undergoes whenever the environment it lives in greatly changes, requiring a different form to survive. Eidein discovered it during its current regeneration cycle, and the creature allowed him to... study it.",

        "originalText": "What he learned during these studies was truly... magnificent. First, I need to discuss the term \"non-coding\" DNA, sometimes referred to as \"junk\" DNA. Non-coding DNA, in simple terms, are DNA sequences of an organism which do not encode protein sequences and therefore have no direct biological functions. For example: Almost 98% of human DNA is non-coding, with only around 2% of the total genome being responsible for what you are, how you look, how you behave. Tchort - only 0.5 % coding but there is a neat little... secret.",

Eidein found this remarkable, but even more remarkable is the fact that this knowledge allows us to do the same thing with humans... as well.",

Only then can you have access to all of the knowledge we possess and help us further understand Tchort; to help not just us Tchortists - but our whole race. Please understand that Tchort is important to us - and so it is to you - and we must propagate this knowledge to all who are willing to listen.
